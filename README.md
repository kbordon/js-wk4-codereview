## Blindspots
**Technical**
* I don't know sass, and I lament knowing I won't really be able to work with React since working with Angular made me really curious about how it differs in architecture.

**Non-Technical**
* Becoming too focused on one spec, and not managing my time properly.
* Social anxiety, whiteboarding, and speaking with confidence.



## Plan of Action
Today, I will look at a few areas that I feel I personally struggle in. I'll spend the first few hours of the day to address these trouble spots, and then if there is enough time, I would like to document it a kind of a blog site. That's the ambition anyway, if it doesn't seem like I'll have enough time, I'll likely just record it in the README.

- After having read this article, I know I'm easily guilty of making goals of self-improvement and having them topple over with their top-heavy aspirations. It's funny, it seems obvious that an approach of slowly tackling your goal in more bite-sized chunks would be a natural approach, but I know I've often disregarded it, not deliberately, but just jumping headfirst into a lake of problems, not knowing what lie beneath the surface. Anyway, went a little off track there. Coming away from this article, I'm sure I can find a way to apply this to my working habits, or at the very least, I'll try.

In an attempt to better manage my work flow, I have a browser tab opened to an online pomodoro timer.


[Learn React.JS in 8 Minutes](https://medium.com/learning-new-stuff/learn-react-js-in-7-min-92a1ef023003)
- Props: From my admittedly shallow understanding, props are immutable pieces of data that you can pass down the a hierarchy of components, very similarly to how we've been sending data down in Angular through input. Just... not with the input set up.
- States: The event handling so far is not too far off from what we learned in Angular, so not lost yet.
- Refs and findDomNode: This was interesting to me because so far this was something that I found lacking in Angular, when I wanted to target a specific DOM element, I either just didn't really know how to, or I had to accomplish it in a very round-about way by using if statements with property bindings. Maybe because you'd just do in some way with Vanilla Javascript? Perhaps there was something in our lessons that I may have missed that actually addressed this, but I do like that React's way of handling referencing seems rather similar jQuery.

- ~~React ToDo:~~

* I decided to try a different tutorial for react learning.
Codecademy: lesson 1
  * JSX is an extension for Javascript, looks like HTML but is used in Javascript files
  * has to be compiled
  * expressions
  * attributes
  * can have nesting and multiple elements but there can only be one outermost element
  lesson 2
  *

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.6.

-- start a blog. I was going to start a blog, but unfortunately,

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
