# Developerreality

## Blindspots
* Becoming too focused on one spec, and not managing my time properly.
* I don't know sass, and I lament knowing I won't really be able to work with React since working with Angular made me really curious about how it differs in architecture.
* Social anxiety, whiteboarding, and speaking with confidence.


## Plan of Action
Today, I will look at a few areas that I feel I personally struggle in. I'll spend the first few hours of the day to address these trouble spots, and then if there is enough time, I would like to document it a kind of a blog site. That's the ambition anyway, if it doesn't seem like I'll have enough time, I'll likely just record it in the README.


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
